The subsidy is dedicated to the cultural sector through a non repayable one-off contribution for the Piedmontese cultural organisations which do not access - or will not access - to the ordinary subsidy about culture, and to companies and operators with VAT number and registered/operative office in Piedmont. They need to work in the cultural area and for its satellite activities.
