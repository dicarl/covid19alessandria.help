Participating the lottery is easy: go to the "Partecipa ora" area in the home page of this portal, digit your tax code (codice fiscale)
and generate your lottery code, then save it and take it with always with you.
Once the lottery begins, if you purchase goods or services of at least â‚¬1, show your lottery code to the merchant and get the match with your
purchase data. Every euro of your purchase turns into a virtual lottery ticket, until a maximum of one thousand virtual tickets for every
receipt.
