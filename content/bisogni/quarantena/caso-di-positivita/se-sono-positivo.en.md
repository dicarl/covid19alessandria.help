The person who is suspected or confirmed as being affected by COVID-19 must stay clear from other relatives, if possible, in a well ventilated single room and must not receive any visits.  
Who is taking care must be healthy and free from deseases which may put him/her at risk, if infected.  
The family members must stay in other rooms or, if impossible, maintaining a distance of at least 1 meter from the sick person and sleeping in a different bed.  
Who takes care of the sick person must wear a surgical mask, setting it correctly on his/her face, when in the same room.  
If the mask is wet or dirty for secretions, it is necessary to substitute it immediately and to wash hands after taking it off.  
Hands must be carefully washed with water and soap or with an hydroalcoholic product after each contact with the sick person or with the surrounding environment, before and after cooking, before eating, after using the bathroom and every time hands may be dirty.
