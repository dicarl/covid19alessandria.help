The project is curated by ASL Alessandria and managed by Social Domus, to respond to the citizenship's necessities and facilitate the decongestion of hospitals.  
The service is dedicated to Covid-19 positive people, who are self-sufficient or asymptomatic and can not spend their isolation at home, for familiar or logistical motivations.  
A room is at disposal until the complete recovery with the timing defined by the regulation of the Health Ministry Circular of October 12th (isolation from 15 to 21 days).  
In this location there are 81 sleeping accomodations and dining is also offered (breakfast, lunch, dinner), as well as technological support (WI-FI and TV).  
The association Social Domus takes care of the direct assistance to Covid guests: assisted hotel facilities, from reception to release (rooms arrangement, laundry, dining, daily support).  
The access to the service for requesting guests is completely free and its admission occurs compulsory through ASL AL (contact person Dr.Silvana Romano) for the isolation management.
