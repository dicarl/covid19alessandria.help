What is the contact tracking?  
I have been identified as a "close contact" of a confirmed COVID-19 case. How should I behave?  
What should I do if the ASL prevention department has not contacted me yet?  
Follow the link to find official answers from the Ministero della Salute (Ministry of Health)
